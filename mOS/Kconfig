	  Build as mOS (short for "multi-O/S"), an experimental kernel
	  for supercomputers which attempts to create a hybrid between a
	  FWK (full-weight kernel--namely, Linux) and a custom LWK
	  (light-weight kernel) in order to acheive better performance
	  and scaling behavior than FWKs alone.

	  Unless you operate a top-500 supercomputer, say N.

	  Enables mOS to manage the GPU resources. This requires the
	  OneAPI Level Zero libraries to be available. If this is not
	  enabled, mOS will not attempt to manage the GPU resource.
